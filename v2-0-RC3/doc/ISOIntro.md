Introduction

The Financial Information eXchange Simple Binary Encoding (SBE) targets high performance trading systems. It is optimized for low latency of encoding and decoding while keeping bandwidth utilization reasonably small. For compatibility, it is intended to represent all FIX semantics. SBE is primarily a fixed length wire format but also supports variable length fields and repeating groups with fixed length entries. The wire format does not contain any meta-data other than length information for variable elements. The meta-data is a message schema provided out-of-band as an XML Schema Definition (XSD) file.
